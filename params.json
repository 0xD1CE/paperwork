It provides a modern web UI, built on top of AngularJS & Bootstrap 3, as well as an open API for third party integration.\r\n\r\nFor the back-end part a MySQL database stores everything. With such common requirements (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), Paperwork will be able to run not only on dedicated servers, but also on small to mid-size NAS devices (Synology (R), QNAP (R), etc.).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (might not be up to date, please use the demo below!)\r\n\r\n![01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/01.png)\r\n![02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/02.png)\r\n![03](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/03.png)\r\n![04](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/04.png)\r\n![05](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/05.png)\r\n![06](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/06.png)\r\n![07](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twostairs/paperwork/gh-pages/images/screenshots/07.png)\r\n\r\n## Demo (yes, there is one!)\r\n\r\nAt [demo.paperwork.rocks](http://demo.paperwork.rocks) you can actually see the current development status of Paperwork. Every night at 3am (CET) the database is being dropped and newly created, and the latest sources from GitHub are being deployed on the machine.\r\n\r\nFeel free to create/modify/delete accounts, notebooks and notes. This demo can be used for heavy playing without regrets. Just try not to take down that thing. :)\r\n\r\n## Initial installation (quick & dirty documented)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you need to clone this project to your machine.\r\nAfter that, make sure that you have PHP >= 5.4.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we don't ship any prebuilt versions, so you need to build the app yourself.\r\nTo do this you must install [composer](http://getcomposer.org) and npm (nodejs package manager,\r\non how to install npm read [here](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm))\r\n\r\nComposer is needed to install third-party application components,\r\nwithout them application will not run.\r\n\r\nAfter you have finished the installation of npm and composer run:\r\n\r\n    cd frontend\r\n    composer install\r\n\r\nAt the point, you now have php dependencies installed.\r\nIt is now time to install tools to build the frontend files. We are using [gulp](http://gulpjs.com)\r\nto build our frontend dependencies.\r\n\r\nFirst you need to install gulp cli globally:\r\n\r\n    sudo npm install -g gulp\r\n\r\nAnd then npm dependencies inside project\r\n\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\nThen you just run the default task\r\n\r\n    gulp\r\n\r\nAfter these steps, you have all components installed and styles and js build,\r\nit is time to configure your database.\r\n\r\nDatabase settings are stored in frontend/app/config/database.php\r\nIf you'd like to use the default DB settings (MySQL/MariaDB), you'll just need\r\nto have the database server running on port 3306 and create a database named\r\n\"paperwork\". You could use the following SQL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDROP DATABASE IF EXISTS paperwork; CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS paperwork DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, you need the \"paperwork\" user to have full access to this database:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON paperwork.* TO 'paperwork'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'paperwork' WITH GRANT OPTION; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these settings, you won't need to modify the database.php configuration file.\r\n\r\nAfter completing these steps, run the migration jobs, that fill the database:\r\n\r\n```\r\nphp artisan migrate\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf anything here should fail, it's most likely an authentication/connection issue, so check your database setup again.\r\n\r\nNow, for the last step, make sure that your webserver has the right to create/modify/delete files within the `frontend/app/storage/attachments/`, the `frontend/app/storage/cache/`, the `frontend/app/storage/logs/` and the `frontend/app/storage/sessions/` folders.\r\n\r\nAlso, be sure to set the document root (docroot) of your webserver to the folder `frontend/public/`. If you don't have access to or don't want/know how to do this, you can use .htaccess to set up temporary rewrite rules to experience Paperwork fully. In the example below, it is assumed that you have all your papaerwork files in a folder named paperwork folder as child of the document root folder.\r\n\r\n1. Create a new file named `.htaccess`\r\n2. Copy and paste this code in it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRewriteEngine on\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !paperwork/frontend/public/\r\nRewriteRule (.*) /paperwork/frontend/public/$1 [L]\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Save the file\r\n\r\nYou can access Paperwork by going to http://localhost or any URL you use to access your machine.\r\n\r\nWhen you need to access any other files from the document root (all folders will be inaccessible), rename the file to something different from `.htaccess`.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. From here on, you should be able to access your paperwork instance through the web.\r\n\r\n## Run using Docker\r\n\r\nBasically you just have to:\r\n\r\n    fig up\r\n\r\nTo run the migrations (once):\r\n\r\n    fig run web php artisan migrate --force\r\n\r\n## Upgrading\r\n\r\nUpgrading to the latest GIT version of Paperwork is fairly easy. Update your local repository running `git pull`, then `cd` into the `frontend/` directory and run `php artisan migrate`. In most cases this should work. If you're experiencing issues, you might need to clear the database completely and re-run the initial installation.\r\n\r\n## API documentation\r\n\r\nThe API documentation can be found at [docs.paperwork.apiary.io](http://docs.paperwork.apiary.io/) or built using the ``apiary.apib`` file from this repository. It's not yet complete and could change at any time!\r\n\r\n## Developing\r\n\r\nDeveloping on Paperwork is fairly easy for anyone who's familiar with Laravel 4. Within `frontend/app/` all internal code can be found, including all source LESS and JavaScript files that are being used to generate the output files that lie in `frontend/public/css/` and `frontend/public/js`.\r\n\r\nIf you need to modify the stylesheet or JavaScript, *DO NOT TOUCH ANY OF THE FILES IN `frontend/public/`*, as they will be overwritten by the generator process. Instead, modify the files in `frontend/app/less/` and `frontend/app/js/`. For building, you'll need Gulp.js.\r\n\r\nSwitch into `frontend` directory on a command line and execute the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nnpm will install all dependencies required through the `package.json`, so that you'll be able to run the generator process yourself. For doing so, simply run the command `gulp` within your `frontend` directory.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe're using [this style of git branching](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). So for development, you should clone the Paperwork repository here on Github, and checkout a new feature branch off from the develop branch (rather than master) such as issue-48-feature. Commit your changes to that branch and then send us pull-requests back into the develop branch.\r\n\r\nThe exception to this rule is urgent hotfixes to master. To perform a hotfix, make a new branch off of master. When you're ready to submit the changes, make a pull request to both the master and develop branches.\r\n\r\n## Some last words\r\n\r\nThe current development status is far from being worth called \"version 1.0\". However, if I could get you interested in this project and you feel like contributing, don't hesitate to ping me by e-mail ([marius@paperwork.rocks](mailto:marius@paperwork.rocks)) or twitter ([@devilx](https://twitter.com/devilx)) so we can talk. :-)\r\n\r\nThere is a #paperwork IRC channel on freenode.net and there is a [gitter](https://gitter.im/twostairs/paperwork) group as well.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n### Can I run Paperwork on a shared host environment, where I'm not able to set `frontend/public` as document root?\r\n\r\nBasically you can. This has nothing to do with Paperwork specifically, though. The foundation ontop of which Paperwork is built up (Laravel) needs to be reconfigured to support a shared host environment. [Here](https://www.google.com/search?q=laravel+4+shared+host) you can find more info about how to do so.\r\n\r\n### Are you planning to implement ... into Paperwork soon?\r\n\r\nMaybe. Check out more detailed information about the features we are currently working on [here](https://github.com/twostairs/paperwork/issues).\r\n\r\n### I would like to join Paperwork development, what's the best way to do so?\r\n\r\nIn addition to contributing, make sure to shoot us an e-mail at [paperwork-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:paperwork-dev@googlegroups.com), or hop on the [gitter group](https://gitter.im/twostairs/paperwork) and inform us about your interest in joining the team. We will then make sure to give you the required access to our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/twostairs/paperwork/issues) as well.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-38443799-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
